# Black-hole-code

#Allows the user to enter a max and min mass or radius, calculates the evap time and luminosity
#Plots a 2D plot for evap time and luminosity, as well as a 3D plot for luminosity/mass/spin
#The spin can be changed using a slider, which allows both luminosity plots to be adjusted without rerunning the program
